These notes intend to help people working on the development version of
GDBM.

* Requirements

You need the following packages to build the development version of GNU
DBM.  We do not make any efforts to accommodate older versions of
these packages, so please make sure that you have the latest stable
version. 

- Automake <https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Libtool <https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>
- Gettext <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
- Texinfo <https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/>
- Bison <https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>
- Flex <https://github.com/westes/flex/>

* Bootstrapping

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to checkout
GDBM from the repository.  The next step is to get other files needed
to build, which are extracted from other source packages: 

1. Change to the source tree directory

   cd gdbm

2. Run

   ./bootstrap 

Once done, proceed as described in the file README.
