* Introduction

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet.
If you are taking source from git repository, you will need to have several
special tools to help contribute.  See the file README-hacking for more
information.  See chapter `Building' for the detailed instructions on
how to build the package.

Please, note that the accompanying documentation may be inaccurate
or incomplete.  The ChangeLog file is the authoritative documentation of
all recent changes.

Please, send comments and problem reports to <bug-gdbm@gnu.org>.

* Checking Out the Sources

The following instructions apply if you wish to obtain sources from
the repository.

To clone the Git repository, run:

  git clone https://git.gnu.org.ua/gdbm.git

This will create a directory named `gdbm' and populate it with
the sources.

If you are not interested in the entire development history, you can
minimize the traffic using the `--depth' option.  For example,

  git clone --depth 1 https://git.gnu.org.ua/gdbm.git

will clone only the most recent revision from the repository.
